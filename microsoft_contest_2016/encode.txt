"Agent Jimmy Bonds? You are a master of obfuscation and the best person for this job. We have a secret message to convey to our friends on the other side of the galaxy, but can't risk anyone else knowing about it. We need your help implementing a Vigenere cipher."

A Vigenere cipher takes plaintext and encrypts it into ciphertext by cyclically applying a cipher key. The encryption adds letter values modulo 26, where A=0, B=1, C=2, .... GOODBYE (6, 14, 14, 3, 1, 24, 4) encrypted with HELLO (7, 4, 11, 11, 14) will give NSZOPFI as the ciphertext (13, 18, 25, 14, 15, 5, 8):

  GOODBYE
+ HELLOHE
  -------
  NSZOPFI
Input definition

An input file for this problem will contain an arbitrary number of lines.

Each line will contain a 64-char plaintext message, a vertical pipe ('|') separator, and a 10-char Vigenere cipher key.

The plaintext message could contain any character between [a-z], any character between [A-Z], and any character in this set: "!@#$%^&*()_-+=[{]};:<>./? ".

The Vigenere cipher key will only contain characters between [A-Z].

As we are a highly secretive agency, the plaintext message might not look very plain -- do not worry, we have just pre-obfuscated it.

Output definition

An output file for this problem should contain the same number of lines as the corresponding input.

Each line should be a 64-char encrypted ciphertext that is the result of applying the 10-char Vigenere cipher key to the 64-char plaintext. Only the characters [a-z] and [A-Z] should be encrypted and the original letter casing of the input should be preserved in the output. Characters not within this range should be transmitted without further obfuscation.
